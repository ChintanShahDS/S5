# EVA V2 - Session 5 - Assignment - Modular Github Code
## First Neural Network for MNIST with CNN, FFN and maxpool blockx

## Modular Code
- Divide the code into 3 main files
    - model.py: *This file holds the model related details*
    - utils.py: *This file holds the utility functions that might be commonly required*
    - S5.ipynb: *Main Notebook file that has the variables, configuration parameters and actual calls

### S5.ipynb
- This is the main notebook file that is used for training the model and checking the outputs
- It also displays the Accuracy and loss curves for training and test across the epochs
- It utilizes the model.py and utils.py as mentioned below for doing the work
- You can run this file directly in Colab using Run all
- ***Recommended to use a GPU for running this file***
- ***2024-02: No need to install anything as per the current Colab verion***

### model.py
- Contains the Model definition

### utils.py
- Planned to put utils like common functions to be used
- Contains the train and test functions and GetCorrectPredCount and drawLossAccuracyPlots
- train
    - Model training method to do forward and backward pass
    - Also to calculate the accuracy
    - Return the loss and accuracy
- test
    - Model validation method to do inference
    - Also to calculate the accuracy
    - Return the loss and accuracy
- GetCorrectPredCount: Gives the count of correct preditions
- drawLossAccuracyPlots: Draws the curves for training and test accuracy and losses
